A Visual Studio Code theme for fans of Twice whose bias is Sana-chan. ðŸ’œ

This is my customized theme that I use for my personal projects and at work.
It makes heavy use of Sana-chanâ€™s official color (purple) and
[Twiceâ€™s official colors (neon magenta and apricot)](https://twitter.com/jypetwice/status/779329700501913600).
The theme is also inspired by the
[Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)
and
[Tokyo Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night)
themes.
